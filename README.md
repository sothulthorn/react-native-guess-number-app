# Guess Number Game App

In this project, we’ll create an interactive Guess the Number game using React Native. The app will prompt the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 99 by inputting a number and pressing a “Confirm” button to submit it. Once the user confirms their guess, the app will provide feedback, indicating whether the guessed number is too high or too low compared to the target number.

The app will feature increment and decrement buttons for the user to adjust their guesses based on feedback until they reach the correct number. Each round of guessing will be counted, and once the user successfully guesses the correct number, the app will display the total number of rounds taken to arrive at the answer.

This project will incorporate:

- A user-friendly interface for inputting numbers and navigating guesses
- Real-time feedback for higher/lower guesses
- A round counter to track the user’s guessing attempts
